      "I've been making art for as long as I can remember, mostly with traditional mediums like watercolour or liners. About a year ago I tried drawing digitally for the first time and fell in love with the endless the possibilities of it. Shortly after I decided to start selling some of my designs on Redbubble. Below are the link to my shop and to some of my (more recent) digital artworks :)",
